#summary Define events and filters

In this exercise, you define another event and add another filter so that the Add To Campaign interaction set can check whether a policy has already been purchased for the car. If so, then the customer is not unnecessarily added to marketing campaigns. As an application evolves, you might typically find that the project has to be updated by the IT user (using Design Data) occasionally before the business user can continue building the business logic in Design.

In this exercise, you add a second filter to the Add To Campaign interaction set. The new filter, called 'Has not purchased a policy' checks for an instance of the PolicyPurchased event being received in the past year for the same car registration (as defined by the context relationship in the interaction set).
