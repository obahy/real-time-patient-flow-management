Simulating events using Test Console

= Introduction =
*Test Console* is , from which events from any source can be simulated.

Here, the test console is used to simulate events of any type from any source (i.e. RTLS, BPM or other system) and send them to the state monitor service. The simulated events are generated by providing a test script to the console which has the ability to send those events manually or automatically.
