Simulating events using Test Console

= Introduction =
*Test Console* is , from which events from any source can be simulated.

Here, the test console is used to simulate events of any type from any source (i.e. RTLS, BPM or other system) and send them to the state monitor service. The simulated events are generated by providing a test script to the console which has the ability to send those events manually or automatically.  


= Testing CEP =
*Why should we test CEP?*

a. To ensure CEP receives simulated events from the Message Broker.

b. To ensure CEP generates proper business events. 


*How do we test CEP?*

*Step1:* Navigate to *Message Broker* console (  http://137.122.88.139:8080/osler-mb/ )

*Step3:* Click on *Choose File* to add the test script file and select the testscript file from  appropriate location.
(say, C:\Users\kavya kumar\Dropbox\Osler Project\Phase 1\TestScripts\CEP Unit Tests\ExtendedScenario\Input)

Ensure that the *Test Mode*  by default is set to *Manual - Allows you to control the timing of each event*
