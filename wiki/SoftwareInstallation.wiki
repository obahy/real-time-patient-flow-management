= IBM BPM Process Designer =

The IBM BPM Process Designer(PD) is the development time tooling used to
design, model and build processes. It is implemented under the covers using the Open Source technology called Eclipse but has a very non-Eclipse like skin applied over it.
IBPM PD can be downloaded from the IBPM Process Center and installed on a user's Windows based workstation.

At a high level IBPM PD allows us to describe business processes using the BPMN notation. The processes are "drawn" visually on the screen canvas and the technical skills needed to achieve this task are as low as can possibly be made.

= How to install BPM Process Designer? =

*Step1:* Run the batch file "installProcessDesigner_admin.bat" from the folder IBM Process Designer.

With successful login, you will see the existing projects/process Apps on the Process Apps page. Note that the currently logged in user is shown in the title of the window.

• Process Apps – Selection of available/existing Process Apps

• Toolkits – Selection of available/existing Toolkits

• Servers – List of the Process Server instances

• Admin – Administration tasks

• Designer – Design/construction of a solution

• Inspector – Debugging/monitoring a solution (usually in test)
