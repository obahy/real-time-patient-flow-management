== Task 4.5: Publish the Project ==

Now that you have completed the data model and business logic definitions in the application, you must publish the project to the !WebSphere Business Events Runtime which is running on your computer so that you can test that it works.

== Procedure ==

1. On the toolbar of Design, click the *Runtime* button, then click *Publish to runtime*. The project of assets is published to the run time.

2. Check the status bar (just below the toolbar).

The status message says *Publishing project: published successfully*.

If the publishing fails, check the error message and fix any problems. Check that you have defined the assets in the project as described in the steps in this topic.

If the publishing still fails, save the project to the project store, then open the project in Design Data to check whether any of the data model assets are showing errors on their icons in the left pane.
