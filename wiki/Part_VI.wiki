== Exercise 6.1 : Overview of the database ==
We will show how to go from the Database to Reports and dashboards.
Remote connect to the url 137.122.93.90 using the lombardi password.

Open the MS Sql Server Management Studio and open the pfmv4 database. In the Database Diagram folder, open dbo_diagram_0. In this diagram, there are the following tables:
patient_event_fact
patient_state_fact

== Exercise 6.2 : Importing the db into framework manager ==
Now, we must use this database, and configure IBM Cognos to connect to it. To do this, we must use the IBM Administration portal. This is located at the url http://137.122.93.90/ibmcognos . This url MUST be opened using Internet Explorer. Once the console shows up, click on the administration link. This will open up the status and health page of cognos for configuration. This is not important for us right now. Navigate to the "Configuration" tab as seen below.

This portal shows all of the current database connections that are available to you in cognos. We must now create a new connection to allow us to connect to  our new database "TestDatabaseBPM"
