== Exercise 6.1 : Overview of the database ==
We will show how to go from the Database to Reports and dashboards.
Remote connect to the url 137.122.93.90 using the lombardi password.

Open the MS Sql Server Management Studio and open the pfmv4 database. In the Database Diagram folder, open dbo_diagram_0. In this diagram, there are the following tables:
patient_event_fact
patient_state_fact

== Exercise 6.2 : Importing the db into framework manager ==

Now, we must use this database, and configure IBM Cognos to connect to it. To do this, we must use the IBM Administration portal. This is located at the url http://137.122.93.90/ibmcognos . This url MUST be opened using Internet Explorer. Once the console shows up, click on the administration link. This will open up the status and health page of cognos for configuration. This is not important for us right now. Navigate to the "Configuration" tab as seen below.

This portal shows all of the current database connections that are available to you in cognos. We must now create a new connection to allow us to connect to  our new database "TestDatabaseBPM". In the top left corner you will see a cylinder with a star beside it. This is the new data source button. Click it, and it will bring you to the next menu below:

This page allows you to specify what the source data program is used. For example, if the database is a Microsoft Access database, the dropdown here will have Microsoft Access selected. In this case, we are using Microsoft SQL Server 2008. 

The next few images show a detailed description of how to configure the connection to the SQL Server, and how to specify which database to connect to. The username and password is located in dropbox under Osler Project/Virtual Server List.xlsx->WAS-Cognos sheet

Once you reach the step above, you have finished configuring the connection, and it is now available for IBM Framework manager. To use IBM Framework Manager, you must be on the university network, and remote desktop to the IP 137.122.93.90  . Once you have logged on using the configuration described in the Virtual Server List.xlsx, press start and click on IBM Framework Manager

Here, we will add the Data Source that was configured in the last couple steps. Follow the steps of the images below to create a project, and add the data connection to it.
