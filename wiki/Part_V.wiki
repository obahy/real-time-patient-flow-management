== Simulation of Events ==

We will open a test console to simulate events taking place at the hospital. For example, we will simulate a patient being triaged, and the patient enters ED, and the Physician enters ED Etc.. 

== Exercise 5.1: Open the Test Console ==
1. Open your browser and go to: http://137.122.88.139:8080/osler-mb/
2. Browse to the shared directory on DropBox and open the corresponding student.xml file. This file contains the test script.
3. Run the tests manually.

Notice that the time stamp is hard coded, so you do not have to wait between events.

Open response log console to verify that your events have been sent.
1. Click home.
2. Under log analytics click on Response Log.
3. Make sure the events have been sent.

Status code should be 200. Other codes correspond to unsuccessful handling of events.
