== Simulation of Events ==

We will open a test console to simulate events taking place at the hospital. For example, we will simulate a patient being triaged, and the patient enters ED, and the Physician enters ED Etc.. 

== Exercise 5.1: Open the Test Console ==
1. Open your browser and go to: http://137.122.88.139:8080/osler-mb/
2. Browse to the shared directory on DropBox and open the corresponding student.xml file. This file contains the test script.
3. Run the tests manually.

Notice that the time stamp is hard coded, so you do not have to wait between events.

Open response log console to verify that your events have been sent.
1. Click home.
2. Under log analytics click on Response Log.
3. Make sure the events have been sent.

Status code should be 200. Other codes correspond to unsuccessful handling of events.


== Exercise 5.2 == 
Open the SME Dashboard to view some basic dashboards.

1. Using your browser, go to: 137.122.93.228:8080/SME
2. Click on Unit map under Map of rooms and patients.
3. You should see a list of patients. Select the patient that your test scripts have created.
4. View patient state charts, Patient states, and the events received.


== Exercise 5.3 ==
We now will look at cognos dashboards that show more reports about the patients and their wait times and states.

1. Open your browser and navigate to: http://137.122.93.90/ibmcognos/cgi-bin/cognos.cgi?b_action=xts.run&m=portal/welcome/welcome.xts

2. Click on Home.
3. Click on SME_V2_Package.
4. Click on Shirely.
5. Click on New.
6. Click on ALl ActivePatients.

This will show you a list of all patients active now. Some of the patients your scripts have created, others created by your colleagues, and maybe others are in the system from before.

7. Open PatientDetailsBullet report, and select the ID of the patient you are interested in.

This report shows the states of the patient and how long he has been waiting at that state. The report also shows relevant information such as the care provider ID, start and end time.

8. Go back to Sirely folder.
8. You can open the following four reports:
